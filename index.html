            <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexiblity for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul id="list">
                    <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>  JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variables holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique name. These unique names are called identifiers.</li>
                    <li><a href="#">Variable Assinment</a>  Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. </li>
                    <li><a href="#">Data Types</a>  Data types are <span id="highlight"> important concept</span>; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean -  or  null -  aka nothing; Number -  or  String -  Array -  and Object - </li>
                    <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a>  When you write code, you want to perform <span id="highlight"> actions for different decisions</span> - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements:  a specific condition is true, do this code in our code block;  to specify a new condition to test, if the first conditional is false;  we execute this block of code;</li>
                    <li><a href="#">Loops</a>  There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing; they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. thats a loop!</li>
                    <li><a href="#">Function</a>  Functions are an encapsulation of code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
